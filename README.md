# My notebook of python
*Here I'll be uploading almost all the knowledge I am learning from python.*

### How can I read your notebook?
1. You have to install Jupyter Notebook (I recommend installing first the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) which contains it)
2. Next, you have to open "Anaconda Navigator" and then launch "Jupyter Notebook". This will open a tab on your browser on localhost.
3. Finally, you have to download my repository as a Zip and open the files with the extension ".ipynb" with Jupyter Notebook.

### What order should I follow to get into Data Science or Machine Learning?
I recommend you the following:
1. Start with the basics of python: */Basics*
2. Continue with Numpy to learn how to operate with matrices: */Numpy*
3. Finally, learn Pandas to operate with tables: */Pandas*
